The major concerns were the speed to load the images. The images were reduced both in size and optimizila image compressor. The speed increased but it is still a concern in slow phone connection.

### Unfixed Bugs

The following bugs were not fixed:

The <\hr> tag was not working on the Nature section. I have tried to change the code, but I couldn't see the error. It works perfectly when I am using a local server, but not when I am using a live server.
